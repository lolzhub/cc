1. After logging into your account at top right corner go to setup(Ghanti ke baju me :)

2. Open developer console

//Doing CRUD Operations....

3. At top left open file > Apec class {
   You have to create 3 files named as: CC_practical, Updatee, Deletee 
   }
   
4. Add this code in CC_practical:
  public class CC_practical {
    public void CreateAccount(String Name, String Phone){
        account acc = new account();
        acc.Name = Name;
        acc.Phone = Phone;
        insert acc;
        System.debug('Account inserted successfully for: '+acc.Name);
    }
}

5. Add this code in Updatee:
public class Updatee {
    public void UpdateAcc(String Name){
        List<Account> oldAcc = new List<Account>();
        for(Account acc: [SELECT Name from Account WHERE Phone='6969696969']){    //please add your name/number
            acc.Name=Name;
            oldAcc.add(acc);
            System.debug('Account has been updated for: '+acc.Name);
        }
        update oldAcc;
    }
}

6. Add this code in Deletee:
public class Deletee {
    public void delAcc(){
		List<Account> oldAcc = new List<Account>();
        for(Account acc: [SELECT Name, Phone from Account WHERE Name='lolzhub']){   //please add your name/number
			delete acc;
            System.debug('Account has been delete for: '+acc.Name);
        }
        update oldAcc;
    }
}

***7. Very Very Important step! SAVE all the files before proceeding

    CC_practical acc = new CC_practical();
    acc.CreateAccount('lolzhub', '6969696969');   //please add your name/number
    
  check the open log box and execute

  Below that open Query Editor and execute the following:
    >>>select Name, Phone from Account

9. To update data:
